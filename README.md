When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.

- We recommend creating a public repository, since private repositories will use Actions minutes.

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.

- Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.

- If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ
